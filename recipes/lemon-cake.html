  <h2>Best lemon cake ever</h2>
  <p>You will not believe how easy it is to makethis delicious lemon cake!</p>
  <p>You will only need a few ingredients that you probably already have in your kitchen.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>

        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, slightly softened</li>
        
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        
        <li>1 Â¾ cups self-rising flour</li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder (Optional)</li>
        
        <li>1 medium lemon, zested</li>  
    </ul>
  <h4>Lemon glaze</h4>  
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium lemon, zested and juiced</li>    
      <li>7 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a loaf pan with parchment paper.</li>  <br>  
      <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift in flour and baking powder gradually; fold with a wooden spoon to be sure flour is combined. Stir in lemon zest.</li><br>
      <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan, being careful not to press it down.</li> <br> 
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Try not to open the oven door early to avoid collapsing the fluffy cake.</li>  <br>
      <li>Meanwhile, make the lemon glaze: Juice the zested lemon from the cake batter into a small bowl. Add zest and juice of second lemon. Stir in sugar until dissolved; taste and add more sugar or lemon juice to suit your taste.</li><br>
      <li>Drizzle glaze over the warm cake and leave to cool in the pan; glaze will harden as the cake cools.</li><br>
    </ol>
